## 🎯 About Me

Analytics Engineer specializing in **Pipeline Automation & Business Intelligence** at The Access Group. I architect end-to-end data solutions that drive measurable business impact—from Databricks ETL pipelines to Power BI executive dashboards.

Transitioned from Mechanical Engineering to Data Analytics, driven by a passion for solving complex problems through data. I thrive in collaborative environments, partnering with cross-functional stakeholders to translate business needs into scalable technical solutions.
